Welcome to the **Shape Vision Lab** at the University of Chile.

We are a research group dedicated to exploring the geometric and visual properties of 3D data. Our work lies at the intersection of `shape analysis`, `3D computer vision`, and `geometry processing`. We investigate both theoretical foundations and practical applications, from symmetry-aware learning to generative models for 3D shapes.

Our team includes undergraduate and graduate students, as well as collaborators from academia and industry. Together, we tackle problems in object recognition, generative modeling, cultural heritage reconstruction, and more.

Feel free to explore our ongoing `projects`, `publications`, and `student theses`. We are always open to new collaborations and ideas—whether you're a student, researcher, or industry partner interested in the 3D world.
